## Key Concepts

### Declarative Stack Management
Eclipse Muto uses declarative stack definitions that describe the desired state of your ROS system. Instead of imperative scripts, you define what you want running, and Muto handles the how.

### Cloud Orhestration - Eclipse Symphony
[Symphony](https://github.com/eclipse-symphony/symphony) is a powerful service orchestration engine that enables the organization of multiple intelligent edge services into a seamless, end-to-end experience. Its primary purpose is to address the inherent complexity of edge deployment by providing a set of technology-agnostic workflow APIs, which are designed to deliver a streamlined experience for users across all device profiles.

Symphony also provides an example portal, that is launched if you follow the [Quick Start](./quick_start.md) guide.

### Edge Orchestration
Muto brings cloud-native orchestration principles to edge robotics, enabling:
- Remote fleet management
- Automated state reconciliation  
- Version control and rollbacks
- Centralized configuration management

### Digital Twin Integration - Eclipse Ditto‚Ñ¢
Each device managed by Muto has a digital twin representation that maintains real-time state synchronization with cloud orchestration platforms.

[Eclipse Ditto‚Ñ¢](https://eclipse.dev/ditto) is a technology in the IoT implementing a software pattern called ‚Äúdigital twins‚Äù.
A digital twin is a virtual, cloud based, representation of his real world counterpart (real world ‚ÄúThings‚Äù, e.g. devices like sensors, smart heating, connected cars, smart grids, EV charging stations, ‚Ä¶).

The technology mirrors potentially millions and billions of digital twins residing in the digital world with physical ‚ÄúThings‚Äù. This simplifies developing IoT solutions for software developers as they do not need to know how or where exactly the physical ‚ÄúThings‚Äù are connected.

With Ditto a thing can just be used as any other web service via its digital twin.


### Ditto Sandbox 
The Muto team provides a sandbox which may be used by everyone wanting to try out Eclipse Muto without starting a dedicated instance of a twin server. Eclipse Muto sandbox is a dedicated instance of Eclipse Ditto. Warning: This sandbox is not set up in a highly available manner and may experience downtimes. Also, the sandbox will be reset from time to time without prior notice.

Visit [Ditto Sandbox](https://sandbox.composiv.ai) for more details
